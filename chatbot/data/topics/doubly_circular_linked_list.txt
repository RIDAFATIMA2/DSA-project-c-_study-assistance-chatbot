Doubly & Circular Linked Lists

Definition:
Doubly Linked List: Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes. Supports insertion/deletion at both ends more easily.

Circular Linked List:
- Tail points back to head, forming a circle.
- Useful for round-robin or circular buffers.

Operations:
- Insert at position: O(1) if node known, otherwise O(n) to find position.
- Deletion similar.

Example: Use doubly list for browser history back/forward.


FAQ:
Q: When to use doubly linked list over singly?
A: Use doubly linked lists when you need efficient backward traversal or easy deletion given a node reference without tracking previous pointer externally.

Q: Use cases for circular lists?
A: Circular lists are handy for round-robin scheduling, implementing cyclic buffers, or representing circular structures where wrap-around is natural.

Pseudocode: Insert after node (doubly)
function insertAfter(node, value):
	newNode = new Node(value)
	newNode.next = node.next
	newNode.prev = node
	node.next.prev = newNode
	node.next = newNode
Pseudocode: Delete node (doubly)
function deleteNode(node):
	node.prev.next = node.next
	node.next.prev = node.prev
	delete node
