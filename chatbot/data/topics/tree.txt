Tree 
Definition: A tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with one designated node as the root. It has no cycles and organizes data in parent-child relationships.

Types:
General Tree: A tree where a node can have any number of children.
Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children.
Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree with ordered structure (left < root < right).
AVL Tree: A self-balancing BST where height difference (balance factor) is −1, 0, or +1.
Red-Black Tree: A balanced BST with color properties ensuring logarithmic height.
Trie (Prefix Tree): A tree for efficient string/prefix search.
B-Tree / B+ Tree: Multi-way balanced trees used in databases and file systems.

Key Properties:
Root: Topmost node.
Parent / Child: Relationship between nodes.
Leaf: Node with no children.
Height of Node: Longest path to a leaf.
Height of Tree: Height of root.
Depth: Distance from root to a node.
Edge: Link between two nodes.

Traversals (General Tree):
DFS (Depth-First Search): Preorder, Postorder
BFS (Breadth-First Search): Level-order traversal

Pseudocode: DFS Preorder (General Tree)
function preorder(node):
    if node == null: return
    visit(node)
    for each child in node.children:
        preorder(child)
Pseudocode: DFS Postorder (General Tree)
function postorder(node):
    if node == null: return
    for each child in node.children:
        postorder(child)
    visit(node)
Pseudocode: BFS Level-Order
function levelOrder(root):
    if root == null: return
    create queue q
    enqueue root to q
    while q is not empty:
        node = dequeue q
        visit(node)
        for each child in node.children:
            enqueue child to q

Example:
Tree structure:
Root = A; children = B, C; B has child D

Preorder: A B D C
Postorder: D B C A
Level-order: A B C D


Applications:
Modeling hierarchical data (filesystems, DOM trees).
Searching (tries, BSTs).
Databases and indexing (B-Trees, B+ Trees).
Expression representation (expression trees).
AI game trees (minimax).

FAQ:

Q: Is a tree a graph?
A: Yes. A tree is a special acyclic connected graph.

Q: What makes a structure a tree?
A: No cycles, exactly one root, and a unique path between any two nodes.

Q: What is the difference between a tree and a binary tree?
A: A general tree allows any number of children per node; a binary tree allows at most two.
