Q: What is a doubly linked list?
A: Linked list where each node has pointers to next and previous nodes, bidirectional pointers

Q: How is a circular linked list different from a regular linked list?
A: Last node points back to first node instead of NULL, forms a circle, continuous structure

Q: What are the main pointer components in a doubly circular linked list node?
A: Data, next pointer, previous pointer, three components

Q: What is the time complexity of insertion at the beginning in a doubly circular linked list?
A: O(1), constant time, O1

Q: How do you traverse a circular linked list without infinite loop?
A: Use a stopping condition comparing with head node, track visited nodes

[MEDIUM]

Q: Explain how to insert a node in a doubly circular linked list.
A: Create new node, adjust pointers to new node from previous and next, maintain circular property

Q: How would you traverse a doubly circular linked list in reverse?
A: Start from tail or use previous pointers, traverse backward until reaching start node

Q: Describe the algorithm to delete a node from a doubly circular linked list.
A: Adjust previous node's next, adjust next node's previous, maintain circular property

Q: What is the advantage of circular linked list for certain applications?
A: No need to check for NULL, suitable for round-robin scheduling, continuous data structures

Q: How do you detect a cycle in a doubly circular linked list?
A: Cycle always exists by design, instead detect if structure is valid, check pointer consistency

[HARD]

Q: Design and implement an LRU Cache using a doubly circular linked list and hash map.
A: Hash map for O(1) access, doubly list for order, move accessed node to front, evict back node

Q: Implement rotation of a doubly circular linked list by k positions. What's the complexity?
A: Find new head at k positions, adjust pointers to rotate, O(k) time, O(1) space

Q: Design an algorithm to split a circular doubly linked list into two circular lists.
A: Find split point, break circular connections, create two separate circles

Q: Reverse a doubly circular linked list in-place. What's the time and space complexity?
A: Swap next and previous pointers for each node, O(n) time, O(1) space

Q: Implement a multi-level doubly linked list iterator with level changing. Design the approach.
A: Track current node and level, support traversal across levels and within levels, handle level transitions
