[EASY]

Q: What is the time complexity of Quicksort on average?
A: O(n log n), nlogn, Onlogn

Q: What is the time complexity of Mergesort?
A: O(n log n), nlogn, Onlogn, guaranteed

Q: What is the main difference between Quicksort and Mergesort?
A: Quicksort in-place divide and conquer, mergesort requires extra space, quicksort unstable

Q: Why is Quicksort called quick?
A: Average case O(n log n) with low constants, fast in practice, efficient partitioning

Q: What is the pivot in Quicksort?
A: Element used to partition array, divides into smaller and larger elements

[MEDIUM]

Q: Explain the partitioning process in Quicksort.
A: Select pivot, place elements smaller to left, larger to right, pivot in correct position

Q: What are different strategies for selecting a pivot in Quicksort?
A: First element, last element, random element, median-of-three, median of medians

Q: Describe the merge operation in Mergesort.
A: Combine two sorted subarrays into one sorted array by comparing elements from each

Q: Why does Mergesort require O(n) extra space?
A: Needs temporary array to merge sorted subarrays, cannot merge in-place efficiently

Q: What pivot selection strategy reduces worst-case O(n^2) in Quicksort?
A: Random pivot, median-of-three, median of medians for O(n log n) guarantee

[HARD]

Q: Design a 3-way partition Quicksort for arrays with many duplicates. What's the improvement?
A: Partition into less than, equal to, and greater than pivot, handles duplicates efficiently

Q: Implement Quicksort with introspective sort. When and why switch to heapsort?
A: Start with quicksort, switch to heapsort if recursion depth exceeds 2*log(n), ensures O(n log n) worst case

Q: Design a hybrid sorting algorithm combining Quicksort, Mergesort, and Insertion Sort.
A: Use quicksort initially, switch to insertion sort for small arrays, mergesort for stability when needed

Q: Analyze the problem of selecting random pivot in Quicksort and optimal selection.
A: Random pivot has worst case O(n^2) probability, median-of-medians guarantees O(n log n) but higher constants

Q: Implement external merge sort for data larger than memory. Describe the algorithm.
A: Divide data into chunks that fit in memory, sort each chunk, merge sorted chunks from disk files
