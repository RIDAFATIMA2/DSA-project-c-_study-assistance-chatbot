Introduction to DSA

Definition:
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is the study of how data can be stored, organized, and processed efficiently. DSA focuses on:
- Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
- Choosing the right data structure for storage and operations
- Designing algorithms with good time and space complexity

Why DSA matters
- Performance: Time and space efficiency matters for large inputs.
- Scalability: Good algorithms scale to larger data.
- Problem solving: DSA helps design systematic solutions and reason about correctness.

Core concepts
- Time complexity (Big-O): measure of steps as a function of input size n.
- Space complexity: additional memory used.
- Trade-offs: e.g., using more memory to get faster access.

Basic roadmap
1. Learn primitive structures (arrays, linked lists)
2. Understand abstract structures (stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables)
3. Sorting and searching algorithms
4. Advanced trees (AVL, red-black), graphs (shortest paths, MST)
5. Practice problem solving and complexity analysis

Example: Linear vs Binary Search
- Linear search checks each element until found: O(n)
- Binary search requires sorted array: O(log n)

Pseudocode: Binary Search
function binarySearch(arr, low, high, key):
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == key: return mid
        if arr[mid] < key: low = mid + 1
        else: high = mid - 1
    return -1


FAQ:
Q: What should I study first in DSA?
A: Start with arrays and linked lists, then stacks/queues, then basic trees and graphs, and sorting/searching algorithms.

Q: How to measure algorithm efficiency?
A: Use time complexity (Big-O) and space complexity; analyze best/average/worst cases when relevant.
