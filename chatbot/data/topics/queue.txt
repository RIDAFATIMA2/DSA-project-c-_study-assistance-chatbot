Queue, Circular Queue, Deque

Queue (FIFO):
- First In First Out
- Operations: enqueue (push at rear), dequeue (pop from front)
- Implementations: linked list, circular buffer

Circular Queue:
- Uses fixed-size array treated circularly with head/tail pointers
- Efficient use of space without shifting elements

Deque (Double-ended queue):
- Insert/remove at both ends
- Implementations: std::deque in C++

Example: Use queue for BFS traversal of graphs.

Pseudocode: BFS using queue
function bfs(start):
    enqueue(start)
    visited[start] = true
    while queue not empty:
        v = dequeue()
        visit(v)
        for neighbor in adj[v]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                visited[neighbor] = true
                enqueue(neighbor)

Definition (short):
A queue is a FIFO (first-in-first-out) linear data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

FAQ:
Q: Queue vs Stack?
A: Queue uses FIFO ordering (enqueue at rear, dequeue at front). Stack uses LIFO ordering (push/pop at top).

Q: When to use a queue?
A: Use queues for scheduling, breadth-first search (BFS), and situations where order of arrival must be preserved.
