Q: What is a hash function?
A: Function that maps data to fixed-size value, produces hash code, maps input to index

Q: What is a hash collision?
A: Two keys hash to same value, different inputs produce same output

Q: What is the ideal time complexity for insertion in a hash table?
A: O(1), constant time, O1, average case

Q: What are the two main components of a hash table?
A: Hash function and collision resolution method, function and strategy

Q: Name two collision resolution techniques.
A: Chaining and open addressing, separate chaining, linear probing

[MEDIUM]

Q: Explain separate chaining collision resolution.
A: Store colliding elements in linked list at same index, resolve collisions with lists

Q: Explain open addressing collision resolution.
A: Find another empty slot in array using probing, linear probing or quadratic probing

Q: What is the load factor in a hash table?
A: Ratio of number of elements to table size, number of entries / table capacity

Q: What is the time complexity of operations with separate chaining as load factor increases?
A: Deteriorates to O(load_factor), O(n) in worst case, depends on collisions

Q: Design a hash function for strings. What properties should it have?
A: Distribute uniformly, deterministic, fast to compute, minimize collisions

[HARD]

Q: Implement rehashing when load factor exceeds threshold. What's the time complexity?
A: Create new larger table, rehash all elements, O(n) time for rehashing operation

Q: Design double hashing as collision resolution method. How does it improve over linear probing?
A: Use second hash function for probing, reduces clustering, better distribution than linear probing

Q: Analyze the probability of collisions using birthday paradox for hash functions.
A: Collisions become likely when n grows, for perfect hash 0 collisions, probability increases quadratically

Q: Implement a hash table with robin hood hashing. What advantage does it provide?
A: Minimize worst-case probe length, steal from rich and give to poor, better performance distribution

Q: Design a cuckoo hashing scheme with two hash functions. How does it handle collisions?
A: Use two hash functions, if slot occupied kick out element to its alternate location, ensures O(1) lookup
