Elementary Sorting Techniques

Bubble Sort:
- Repeatedly swap adjacent elements if out of order
- Worst-case O(n^2), stable

Insertion Sort:
- Build sorted region by inserting next element into correct position
- Best O(n) for nearly-sorted arrays, worst O(n^2), stable

Selection Sort:
- Repeatedly select the minimum element and put it in place
- O(n^2), unstable, minimal swaps

When to use:
- Small arrays, nearly-sorted data, educational purposes

Pseudocode: Insertion Sort
for i = 1 to n-1:
    key = arr[i]
    j = i-1
    while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
        arr[j+1] = arr[j]
        j = j-1
    arr[j+1] = key

FAQ:
Q: Which elementary sort is best for nearly-sorted arrays?
A: Insertion sort performs very well (O(n)) on nearly-sorted arrays.

Q: Are elementary sorts good for large data?
A: No, for large datasets use O(n log n) algorithms like merge sort or quicksort.

Example:
Given arr = [2,1,3], insertion sort will produce [1,2,3] by inserting elements into the sorted prefix.

Pseudocode: Bubble Sort (simple)
for i = 0 to n-2:
    for j = 0 to n-2-i:
        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]: swap arr[j], arr[j+1]
