Binary Heap, Heap Sort, Priority Queue

Definition:
Binary Heap:A heap is a binary tree where the parent's value is always bigger or smaller than its children.
- A complete binary tree represented as array
- Min-heap: parent <= children; Max-heap: parent >= children
- Operations: insert O(log n), extract-min/max O(log n)

Heap Sort:
- Build heap (O(n)), then repeatedly extract to get sorted order: O(n log n)
- Not stable, can be in-place

Priority Queue:
- Abstract data type supporting insert and extract-min/max
- Implemented efficiently using binary heap


FAQ:
Q: Binary heap vs BST for priority queue?
A: Binary heap gives O(1) access to top priority and O(log n) insert/extract; BSTs can give ordered traversal but are less efficient for priority queue operations.

Q: Is heap sort stable?
A: No, heap sort is not stable by default.

Pseudocode:
HEAPSORT(A):
    n :length(A)
    BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A)
    for i ← n downto 2:
        swap A[1] and A[i]
        heap_size ← heap_size - 1
        MAX-HEAPIFY(A, 1)
Heapify (sift-down) for index i in array-backed heap
function heapify(arr, n, i):
	largest = i
	l = 2*i + 1; r = 2*i + 2
	if l < n and arr[l] > arr[largest]: largest = l
	if r < n and arr[r] > arr[largest]: largest = r
	if largest != i:
		swap(arr[i], arr[largest])
		heapify(arr, n, largest)
Pseudocode: Build-heap
for i = n/2 - 1 downto 0: heapify(arr, n, i)

Example: Use heap to implement priority queue where top is max/min element.
