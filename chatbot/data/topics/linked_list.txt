Linked List (Singly)

Definition:
A linked list is a linear collection of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

Operations:
- Insertion at head: O(1)
- Deletion when node known: O(1)
- Search by value: O(n)

Pseudocode: Insert at head
function insertHead(head, value):
    node = new Node(value)
    node.next = head
    head = node
    return head
Pseudocode: Delete by value
function deleteValue(head, value):
    prev = null; cur = head
    while cur != null and cur.value != value:
        prev = cur; cur = cur.next
    if cur == null: return head
    if prev == null: head = head.next
    else: prev.next = cur.next
    delete cur
    return head
Pseudocode: Reverse a singly linked list (iterative)
function reverse(head):
    prev = null
    cur = head
    while cur != null:
        next = cur.next
        cur.next = prev
        prev = cur
        cur = next
    return prev // new head

Example: Insert at head and reverse to get last-in-first-out order.

Tips:
- Linked lists are flexible for insertion/deletion when position is known.
- Random access is O(n), so not good for indexing.


FAQ:
Q: Array vs Linked List?
A: Arrays offer O(1) index access and contiguous storage; linked lists offer O(1) insertion/deletion at known positions and flexible size but O(n) access by index.

Q: When to use a linked list?
A: Use linked lists when frequent insertions/deletions in the middle are needed and random access is not required.
