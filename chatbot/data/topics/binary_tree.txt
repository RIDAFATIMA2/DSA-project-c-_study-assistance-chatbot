Binary Tree : Properties and Types

Definition:
A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children: left and right.

Types:
- Full binary tree: every node has 0 or 2 children
- Complete binary tree: all levels filled except possibly last, filled left to right
- Perfect binary tree: all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at same depth

Traversals:
- Preorder (root, left, right)
- Inorder (left, root, right)
- Postorder (left, right, root)

Pseudocode: Preorder recursive
function preorder(node):
    if node == null: return
    visit(node)
    preorder(node.left)
    preorder(node.right)
Pseudocode: Inorder recursive
function inorder(node):
    if node == null: return
    inorder(node.left)
    visit(node)
    inorder(node.right)
Pseudocode: Postorder recursive
function postorder(node):
    if node == null: return
    postorder(node.left)
    postorder(node.right)
    visit(node)


Example:
Consider tree with root 1, left child 2, right child 3; Preorder traversal: 1 2 3; Inorder: 2 1 3; Postorder: 2 3 1

Applications:
- Expression trees, binary heaps (specialized), binary search trees


FAQ:
Q: What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree (BST)?
A: A BST is a binary tree with the ordering property (left < node < right). A general binary tree need not obey this.

Q: What is preorder traversal pseudocode?
A: Preorder: visit node, traverse left subtree, traverse right subtree. (See Pseudocode section above.)
