Time and Space Complexity

Definition:
Complexity measures how time or memory usage grows with input size, usually expressed in Big-O notation.

Common complexities:
- O(1): constant
- O(log n): logarithmic
- O(n): linear
- O(n log n): linearithmic
- O(n^2): quadratic

Example:
Binary search is O(log n); insertion into array at beginning is O(n).

FAQ:
Q: What does average vs worst-case mean?
A: Worst-case is the maximum cost across inputs of size n; average is the expected cost over typical inputs or a distribution.

Q: How to reduce complexity?
A: Use better algorithms or data structures (e.g., from O(n^2) to O(n log n)), use indexing, caching, or parallelism where applicable.
