Arrays

Definition:
An array is a contiguous block of memory holding elements of the same type, accessible by index.

Key operations:
- Access by index: O(1)
- Traversal: O(n)
- Insertion/deletion at arbitrary position: O(n)

Related algorithms:
- Linear search: scan elements, O(n)
- Binary search: on sorted arrays, O(log n)

Example: Binary Search Pseudocode
(see intro topic for binary search pseudocode)

Tips:
- Use arrays for random access when size is known or resizing is rare.
- Use vector (C++) when dynamic resizing required.

FAQ:
Q: What is the difference between an array and a linked list?
A: Arrays use contiguous memory and allow O(1) random access by index; linked lists use nodes and pointers allowing O(1) insert/delete at known positions but O(n) access.

Q: When should I use an array?
A: Use arrays when you need fast indexed access and size is fixed or resizing is rare; use dynamic arrays (vector) when resizing is needed.

Pseudocode: Binary Search (iterative)
function binarySearch(arr, key):
	low = 0; high = n-1
	while low <= high:
		mid = (low + high) // 2
		if arr[mid] == key: return mid
		if arr[mid] < key: low = mid + 1
		else: high = mid - 1
	return -1
Example:
arr = [1,3,5,7,9]
binarySearch(arr,7) -> index 3
