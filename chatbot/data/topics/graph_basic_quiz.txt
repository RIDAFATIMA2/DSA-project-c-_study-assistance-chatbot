Q: What are the main components of a graph?
A: Vertices and edges, nodes and connections, vertices connected by edges

Q: What is the difference between a directed and undirected graph?
A: Directed has one-way edges, undirected has two-way edges, direction matters

Q: What is the time complexity of BFS on a graph with V vertices and E edges?
A: O(V + E), linear in vertices and edges, OVE

Q: What is the time complexity of DFS on a graph?
A: O(V + E), linear in vertices and edges, OVE

Q: Name the main difference between BFS and DFS traversal.
A: BFS uses queue for level-order, DFS uses stack for depth-first, BFS explores breadth first

Q: Explain the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for graphs.
A: Start from source, visit neighbors level by level using queue, explores all neighbors before going deeper

Q: Explain the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for graphs.
A: Start from source, explore as far as possible along path using stack or recursion, backtracks when stuck

Q: How do you represent a graph using an adjacency list?
A: Array of lists where each index is vertex and list contains adjacent vertices, sparse graph representation

Q: What is the difference between adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations?
A: List is O(V+E) space for sparse, matrix is O(V^2) space but O(1) edge lookup

Q: How would you detect if a graph is connected?
A: Run BFS or DFS from any vertex, if all vertices visited then connected, use traversal count

[HARD]

Q: Implement cycle detection in an undirected graph using DFS. What's the algorithm?
A: Track visited nodes and parent, if neighbor visited and not parent then cycle exists

Q: Design an algorithm to find all connected components in an undirected graph.
A: Run DFS or BFS from each unvisited vertex, each traversal finds one connected component

Q: Explain topological sorting for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
A: Order vertices such that for every edge u->v, u comes before v, use DFS with finish times

Q: How would you find strongly connected components in a directed graph?
A: Use Kosaraju or Tarjan algorithm, find SCCs with DFS and transpose graph operations

Q: Design bipartite graph detection algorithm. What's the time complexity?
A: Color graph with two colors using BFS/DFS, if coloring succeeds graph is bipartite, O(V+E) time
