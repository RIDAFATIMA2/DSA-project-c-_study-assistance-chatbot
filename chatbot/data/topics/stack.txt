Stack (LIFO)

Definition:
A stack is a linear data structure which follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). Elements are added/removed from the top.

Operations:
- push(x): insert x at top
- pop(): remove top
- top/peek(): access top element

Pseudocode: Push/Pop
function push(stack, x):
    stack.push(x)
function pop(stack):
    if stack.empty(): return ERROR
    return stack.pop()

Example:
Push sequence: push(1), push(2), push(3) => stack top is 3; pop() returns 3

FAQ:
Q: Stack vs Queue?
A: Stack is LIFO (last-in-first-out); Queue is FIFO (first-in-first-out). Use stacks for DFS, recursion simulation, undo operations.

Q: When to use a stack?
A: Use a stack for expression evaluation, backtracking, implementing recursion iteratively, and DFS traversal.
